        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Hank Atherton, a developer and artist from Seattle,
          Washington. I spend most of my time developing short game experiences,
          producing and performing music, and developing my skills in
          programming and beyond, always hungry for a new creative outlet.

          <h3>Software Development</h3>
          <p>
            I have experience developing applications in C++, C#, and employ a
            basic knowledge of CSS/HTML. Currently, I am developing my skills in
            problem solving in code by taking on a variety of development tasks
            such as game development, coding puzzles, and web applications.

            src="/images/video-game.png"
            alt="game-img"
          />
          <h3 style="text-align: right">Game Design</h3>
          <p>
            Using the Unity game engine, I have created a handful of prototype
            games with basic functionality while participating in game jams, and
            exploring ideas in longer-form personal projects to tackle
            programming problems more complicated than can be covered in a short
            development sprint.

          <h3>Music Production</h3>
          <p>
            Since I was a child, I've been increadibly involved in music
            production no small thanks to my early exposure to live audio
            production while assisting in family bands. I have been recording,
            mixing, and mastering my own projects songs, as well as freelance
            for other artists for 10 years. I have created from scratch most of
            the audio and music for my game and video projects, including
            scoring a feature-length film.
